## 1. 📝 Problem Statement

Finding the maximum and minimum values of a large dataset is a simple but useful computation for studying parallel processing.

In a sequential approach, the elements are examined one after another. In the OpenMP approach, the dataset is divided among multiple CPU threads so that different threads can search different portions of the data concurrently.

This experiment compares the sequential and OpenMP implementations by measuring execution time for different thread counts and dataset sizes.

**Speedup** and **efficiency** are also calculated to understand the effect of parallelization overhead.

### 🧵 OpenMP Parallel Design

The search loop is parallelized using OpenMP reduction:

```c
#pragma omp parallel for reduction(min:minimum) reduction(max:maximum)
```

Each thread searches its assigned portion of the dataset and maintains local minimum and maximum values.

OpenMP combines the partial results into the final minimum and maximum values.

---

# 6. 🧪 Execution

## 6.1 🖥️ Open Ubuntu on WSL2

Open the **Ubuntu terminal** in Windows.

First, check whether GCC is installed:

```bash
gcc --version
```

Check Python:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Check Git:

```bash
git --version
```

These commands confirm that the required tools are available.

---

## 6.2 📂 Navigate to the Project Directory

Go to the directory containing the experiment:

```bash
cd PGC-parallel-maximum-minimum-openmp
```

Check the files and folders:

```bash
ls
```

The project directory contains files/folders such as:

```text
README.md
generate_graphs.py
src
data
results
graphs
```

---

## 6.3 📁 Check the Source Files

Move into the source directory:

```bash
cd src
```

List the source files:

```bash
ls
```

The source directory contains:

```text
sequential_maxmin.c
maxmin_openmp.c
```

Return to the project root:

```bash
cd ..
```

---

## 6.4 🔨 Compile the Sequential Program

Compile the sequential C program using GCC:

```bash
gcc src/sequential_maxmin.c -o sequential_maxmin

### 🔍 Analysis

* 🧵 The **8-thread configuration** produced the lowest measured parallel execution time.
* 📉 The speedup remains below **1** for all tested configurations.
* ⚙️ The sequential search is a very small computation, so OpenMP thread creation, scheduling and reduction introduce noticeable overhead.
* 🧵 Increasing the number of threads does not automatically produce proportional speedup.
* 📦 The data-size experiment shows that execution time increases as the number of elements increases because every element must be examined.
* 💡 The experiment demonstrates that useful parallel performance depends on the amount of computation relative to parallelization overhead.

* 💰 Processing financial or transaction data.
* 🖼️ Image and video data analysis.

# 12. 🏁 Conclusion

The experiment successfully implements **maximum and minimum search** using both sequential C and OpenMP parallel processing.

The program was tested with different numbers of threads and different dataset sizes. Execution time, speedup and efficiency were calculated and visualized using graphs.

The results show that the **8-thread configuration gave the lowest measured parallel execution time**, but the speedup remained below 1 because the maximum/minimum search performs very little computation compared with the overhead of creating and managing OpenMP threads and combining reduction results.

The data-size experiment also shows that execution time increases as the dataset size increases.

Overall, the experiment demonstrates the importance of considering both **computation size and parallelization overhead** when evaluating OpenMP performance.
